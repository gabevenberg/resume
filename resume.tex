\section*{keywords}
	{\small
	If you, a human, are reading this, you dont have to. This is just a list of keywords that the automated filters always want, but are either just alternate wordings of things already on the resume, are in places of the resume that I have found parsers have trouble with, or are trivial (like office experience). All keywords \emph{are} applicable to me.
